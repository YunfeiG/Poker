# Poker
I am MIA in Arborea, but still alive IRL and want to write a Poker game because I am a noob.

## Calc24
Draw 4 cards from a deck, input a math expression with the points from those cards and basic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and brackets) to make it equal to 24. If you failed to do so, output all possible expressions that equal to 24.
